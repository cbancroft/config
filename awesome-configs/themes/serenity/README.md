## Description ##

Serenity is a simplified Conscience theme, based on its night mode. It
includes gradient taskbar and a few on-screen widgets.

Note that I don't use layout indicator because I use tiling layouts
very rarely and even then few ot them.

Serenity depends on the following projects:

* [awesome 3.5](http://git.naquadah.org/awesome.git)
